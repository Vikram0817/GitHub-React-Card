# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Current position 
    - 90 - 300 hrs
    - 100 hr per month
    - 25 hr/week i.e nothing!

- To go 45 hr/week
    - 1.8 x Currnt time i.e 1.8 x 25
    - 7.5 hrs a day, 6 days a week

- 15.5 hrs/day for ->
    - 8 hr sleep
    - 1 hr wake-up
    - 2 hr workout
    - 2.5 hrs talk
    - total - 12.5
    - 3 hrs left for ->
        - 1 hr to eat 
        - 1 hr to bath and self care
        - 1hr to travelling, packing, getting fresh

- Day in life -> 
    - Day starts one night before that day
    - Sleep at 10:30 PM sharp to complete 8 hrs till next morning 7:30 AM
    - Afterwords, 1 hr for meditation, read and other human stuff
    - Study from 8:30 - 11 AM (2.5 hrs)
    - Bath and self care - 11 - 12 Noon
    - Study from 12 - 3 PM (3hrs)
    - Take a short break if needed and go for a walk or have some sprouts or fruits
    - Study 3:30 - 5:30 PM (2hrs)
    - Get ready for gym and spend 5:30 to 8:00 their
    - Talk from 8 to 10:30 PM
    
- Total study if I follow this stricktly -> 2.5 + 3 + 2 = 7.5 hrs
- Total time per week -> 7.5 x 6 = 45 hrs
- Per month -> 45 x 4 = 180
- Per 100 days -> 7.5 x 100 = 750 hrs.

Finally, to Complete 1000 hrs it will take only 133 days(excluding sundays) and 3.6 years to become the master in it. Where as with Current speed it will take around 9.1 years. Now the decision is yours to make!
